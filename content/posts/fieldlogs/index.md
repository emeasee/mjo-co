FieldLogs is a cloud-based app eco-system (iOS, Android, Google Glass, Web) that helps businesses define and optimise a company's "Job Execution Framework". Our main features allow companies to capture & interpret field operation data in real-time and collaborate within Teams to create & improve Standard Work Procedures.

Working with a small team of developers and business experts my role was to provide artistic direction, police quality assurance and make sure our products stay in line with our UX vision.

My main contributions were in the helping shape the User Experience, visual design and interaction of our core product FieldLogs. (see more at https://www.fieldlogs.com)
