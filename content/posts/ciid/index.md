The Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design presents an integrated environment for participants, faculty, and staff to work together in a multicultural, multidisciplinary studio environment.

We continuously develop our definition of interaction design through the evolving nature of our curriculum. Led by a ‘learning by doing’ philosophy and a life-centered approach, participants are encouraged to explore topics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals before generating ideas. These concepts are then prototyped in the digital fabrication lab.

The Interaction Design Programme teaches fundamental skills, methods, and tools related to tangible/product interactions, graphical/screen interactions, and service design/strategic interactions. We aim to push the boundaries of interaction design by hosting a diverse selection of international visiting faculty who are highly regarded experts in their respective fields.
