AJOTO was founded in 2011 with a clear vision; to create the ultimate collection of timeless tools for your journey, which combines the precision of advanced manufacture with the soul of craft. 

Every piece in our collection tells an incredible story that celebrates the people, places and processes involved in its creation. This is why we only partner with the best factories across the UK and Europe to produce each component.
